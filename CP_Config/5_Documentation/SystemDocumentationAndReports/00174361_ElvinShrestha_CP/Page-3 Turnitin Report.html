Chapter 1: Introduction Project Introduction Automated Academic Organization System (AAOS) is the automated information system featured collectively with content management system, automated data-driven systems and data- analysis system. This information system is useful for every academic institutions as it provides centralized information of all the stakeholders and helps in decision making from appropriate analysis of institutions’ data. Project Background and Justification This software provides digital features for all the stakeholders including the business stakeholders, academic staffs, pupils in the educational institutions. This information system will appropriately centralize the voluminous data of the educational institution by using the digital technology instead of traditional method. Project Overview This complete system is designed to address the traditional problems in an educational institution. The three major parts of the system are content management system, automated information system and data-analysis system. Features ? Centralized Academic Information ? Content Management System for organization, student, academic details and other relevant academic institution factors. ? Multi-user application along with access control on the basis of authorization level. ? Automated tasks include exam notices, lecture notices, transaction notifications, etc. ? Tabular and graphical representation of student report, schedules, transactions history, etc. Aims and Objectives of the project Aims ? A centralized and robust information system that can manage the educational sectors and provide convenient way to perform transactions. Objectives ? Computerize the transactions in an educational institution. ? Visually represent the information of different sectors in an organization. ? Automate trivial activities related to a particular transaction or activity. Chapter 2: Analysis 2.1 Introduction to Analysis Analysis is the systematic and descriptive process of evaluating the complex domain and illustrating the complex domain as a simple module or sub-system by breaking them further apart. It is the first stage where all the primary requirements are identified and gathered for further analysis and problem solving. Without analysis, further improvement cannot be imagined. Analysis phase helps in the identification and formulation of Proof of concept (PoC). The identified requirements are then analyzed using a chosen analysis methodology. 2.2 Analysis Methodology The preferred analysis methodology <a href="javascript:openDSC(3600486549, 3722, '2207');" onmouseover="doRollover(1);" onmouseout="undoRollover(1);" id="2207" name="1" style="color:red" class="red"><span class="b-ref">1</span>is Object Oriented Analysis (OOA). Object Oriented Analysis (OOA) is process of discovery where a development team understands and models the requirements of the system. In OOA requirements are organized as objects. It integrates all the process and data. But in others or traditional structural analysis both process and data are considered independently/separately. They use flow chart/structure charts for process and ER diagrams for data. But in OOA some advance models are used. The common models used in OOA are: Use cases, Object models. Use cases describe pictures or overview for standard domain functions that the system must achieved. Object models describe the names, class relations, operations, and properties of the main objects. User-interface prototypes can also be created for better understanding</a> (Cybarlab, 2017). OOA Modellings In OOA, there various modelling methodologies: Static Modelling, Dynamic Modelling and Functional Modeling. These modelling methodologies of OOA are specifically applied in Design phase of this project. ? Static Modelling It shows the relationship between the static constituents of the system. Static modelling are usually represented by Class diagram. Hence, the overall system’s structure is modelled in this modelling. In this analysis phase, initial class diagram is modelled with the identification of primary requirements. ? Dynamic / Functional Modelling This modelling represents the behavioral aspects of the system. Dynamic and functional modelling can be generalized as a single modelling method where the control information are represented by series of events and operations that happen in the objects. Use case diagram, Sequence diagram, Activity diagram represents the dynamic model of the system. 2.3 Feasibility Study In technical term, feasibility study is an assessment measure taken by the project owner in order to determine positive and negative outcomes, perform cost-benefit analysis and identify relevant factors that affect the project for its completion. There are various factors to consider in order to declare the project to be feasible. And they include social, operational, technical, legal, economical, etc. Factors Summary Feasibility Study Will it reduce organizational costs? Yes Economic Will it provide economic benefits to the organization? Yes Can small organization afford the system? Is the product scalable as per the organization size? May be Will there be a significant effect to the product by branding of similar other products? May be Social Will there be any need for further management of development time-box due to cultural and environmental factors? May be Is the proposed product sustainable in future market as per the organization trends? Yes Can rapid development of the product be achieved? Yes Technological Can the product be compatible with emerging technologies? Somewhat Can we quickly mend the vulnerable dependency in the system? Yes Legal or Can change in government regulation affect the product market value? May be Political Is there any chance of possible affect to the product due to change in trade regulations? No 2.4 Software Requirement Specification (SRS) Software Requirement Specification is the document that describes the software system that is going to be developed with inclusion of functional and non-functional requirements along with relevant other use cases that finalizes the quality product. It is sometime called as Software or Requirement Engineering as well. As the development methodology is preferred to be PXP (Personal Extreme Programming) which is endorsed by Agile methodology, the requirements are collected and recorded as Product Backlog Items where the user’s story are appropriately and concisely presented. In case of this project, the requirements are solely identified by me through the research of current academic organization situation. Functional Requirements These requirements are the ones that are very essential for the product to meet the behavioral requirement. It is the backbone of the proposed system. These requirements are focused with major priority. ID Title Description Rational Dependencies FR-01 User Registration Administrator should be able to add new user. To entry new user so that different academic stakeholders can access their custom profiles. N/A FR-02 User Login and Authentication Registered users should be able to login after authentication is passed. To validate and authorize the user login. FR-01 FR-03 Organization’s details Entry Users with granted permission should be able to add organization detail. To add details in organization CMS FR-02 FR-04 Organization’s detail Update Permitted user should be able to edit existing details. To edit existing details of organization. FR-03 FR-05 View Organization’s details All users should be able to view organization’s information To display organization details.

With the making of different design models, the design phase will be completed. The implemented design models are mentioned below as: ? Structural Modelling ? Behavioral Modelling ? Database Modelling ? Architectural Modelling ? User Interface Modelling Structural Modelling This modelling methodology represents the system in various components along with their communication. Class Diagram and Data Flow Diagram has been applied in order to produce the structural model of the system. Final Class Diagram Definition It is a structure diagram that falls in the category of static diagram or static modelling where the system’s structure is represented by the classes, their attributes, operations and relationship among different class or objects. Justification The reasons for approaching this modelling methodology are mentioned below: ? It clearly states the major components of the system which may be classes or interfaces. ? The type of entity can be distinguished easily with the study of attributes of the class. ? The relationship among different classes is represented clearly with the help of different notations. ? Class Diagram also lists out possible operations of the entity or class in a system. Notations Name Notation Description Class Represents the entity that defines the object. Interface Holds an abstract set of properties and methods. Enumeration Represents a enumerated data type. Package Holds a collection of classes, or interface or enums. Generalization Represents a generalized superclass which holds shared characteristics. Realization Represents a characteristics of a class defined by another class. Dependency Represents a class dependent to another class. Aggregation Represent part of relationship meaning that each class exists independently Composition Represents an aggregation relationship but child cannot exists without parents. Actual Diagram The class diagram has been decomposed into multiple sub-diagram as mentioned below: Image- 24: Package com.elvin.aaos Image- 25: Pacakge com.elvin.aaos.core Image- 26:Package com.elvin.aaos.core.service Image- 27: Package com.elvin.aaos.core.validation Image- 28: Package com.elvin.aaos.core.model Image- 29: Package com.elvin.aaos.core.model.dto Image- 30: Package com.elvin.aaos.core.model.entity Image- 31: Package com.elvin.aaos.web Diagram Description This class diagram represents a package-level class diagram where each package has a hierarchy as mentioned below: ? com.elvin.aaos o core • model ? dto ? entity ? enums ? mapper ? repository • service • utility • validation o mail o web • controller • error • init • session • utility ? auth Data Flow Diagram Definition Data Flow Diagram is also a diagram that falls in structural modelling.

In case of resetting password, a password is reset through email which is an interruptible activity. The activity performed by the user are all composed in swim lane named User. Similarly, the system’s activity is composed in swim lane named System. Image- 36: User Profile Management <a href="javascript:openDSC(86916940, 2, '972');" onmouseover="doRollover(14);" onmouseout="undoRollover(14);" id="972" name="14" style="color:#9c6331" class="#9c6331"><span class="b-ref">14</span>Activity Diagram<span> The </span>activity diagram shows the</a> behavioral model when the user is added. Furthermore, in case of student or faculty member, the activity of the system extends in order to manage the profile which are represented by the decision node. Image- 37: Academic Operation Activity Diagram The activity diagram above shows three different swim lanes for User, Academic System and Notice. The User swim lane is composed with multiple decision node which allows admin or student or faculty member manage transactions and notices. Similarly, the Academic System swim lane is composed with fork node to run parallel activities while manipulating the transactions. Furthermore, the Notice swim lane comprises of decision node along with both fork node and join node to manage notices. Image- 38: Student CMS Activity Diagram The diagram above shows the behavioral model when the operations are carried out in student’s system. The swim lane named Student CMS comprises of interruptible region while sending an email to the user. Moreover, the Notify User send signal represents that the notification is sent to the user which is received by the user as a See Notification accept signal. <a href="javascript:openDSC(1566982249, 1, '459');" onmouseover="doRollover(7);" onmouseout="undoRollover(7);" id="459" name="7" style="color:#009cff" class="#009cff"><span class="b-ref">7</span>Sequence Diagram<span> Definition </span>Sequence Diagram<span> shows </span>the<span> interaction of </span>the objects<span> within </span>the</a> program flow which helps to identify the message sequence. Justification The reasons for approaching this modelling methodology are mentioned below: ? Besides dynamic view of the system like shown by Activity diagram, it also keeps time sequence as an essential part of the diagram. ? It clearly shows the lifetime of the object in the system during task execution. ? It provides detail visual representation of how objects communicate with each other within the program flow. Notations Name Notation Description Actor Represents the entity’s role Lifeline Represents an individual participant. Activations Represents an operation period of an element. Call Message Represents the invocation message that invocate communication between lifelines. Return Message Represents the reply message to the caller. Recursive Message Represents the message invocated in same lifeline. Sequence Fragment Loop fragment represents that the fragment may execute multiple times. Alt fragment represents only single execution whenever the condition matches. Par fragment represents parallel execution. Actual Diagram and Description Image- 39:Login Sequence Diagram The sequence diagram above represents a single actor User who initiate the communication between different objects within five different lifelines. The optional sequence fragments are for user login and reset password in case needed. In addition, the alternate sequence fragment in case of user login represents that user is redirect into different view as shown in the figure. Similarly, in case of reset password, the view is alternate as per the response. Image- 40:User <a href="javascript:openDSC(1566982249, 1, '465');" onmouseover="doRollover(7);" onmouseout="undoRollover(7);" id="465" name="7" style="color:#009cff" class="#009cff"><span class="b-ref">7</span>Sequence Diagram The sequence diagram<span> above shows </span>the<span> communication </span>between different<span> lifelines or </span>objects<span> when </span>the</a> user information is manipulated. In case of adding or updating the user, the alternate sequence fragment represents that the view will be manipulated as per the response object status. Besides, other messages are transmitted in the system as shown in the diagram. Image- 41:Organization Sequence Diagram The sequence diagram above shows the interaction of the objects while managing the information of the organization. In case of organization information, the whole interaction is optional and is represented by the optional sequence fragment. However, in case of building or room, the flow of message is normal and the flow can alternate as per the response from different lifelines represented by alternate sequence fragment. Image- 42:Student Sequence Diagram The sequence diagram shows various lifelines and their interaction through lifeline activations. The flow of message is as shown in the diagram. In case of report generation of the student, two parallel activities that are to present the report in the system’s view and send an email is presented by the parallel sequence fragment. Image- 43:Faculty Sequence Diagram The faculty sequence diagram is similar to the student sequence diagram except the lifelines and messages. The flow of message while managing the profile is identical to the flow of message in student sequence. And, the parallel sequence fragment represents two activities that are report generation by the faculty member and sending email to the student about report generation. Database Modelling This modelling methodology presents the proposed logical design of the database along with the data dictionary. The logical database design is obtainable through Entity Relationship Diagram (ER Diagram).

It is an approximation, and it captures the different properties of the system. It is a scaled-down version and is built with all the essential details of the system.</a> (ScienceDirect, 2018) Justification The reasons for approaching this modelling methodology are mentioned below: ? It helps to easily identify the characteristics of the system and model it. ? It helps to visualize the information with the help of models. ? The basic knowledge of the system can be extracted from this modelling methodology. Notations used The notations used for this modelling are tabulated below: Name Notation Description Component This notation represents the components of the system. It is generalization of various others components like class, interface, services, repositories. Database This notation represents the database used by the system. Data/Process Flow This notation represents the program flow. Actual Diagram Image- 51: Architectural Model Diagram Description The request of the client is handled by the DispatcherServlet, then appropriate controller is selected by HandlerMapping where the request URL is mapped and finally it returns the controller. DispatcherServlet forwards the process to HandlerAdapter where it calls Controller for executing the business logic. Controller executes the business logic. Business logic are implemented in different layers: Service layer, Repository layer or Data Access Object and the database. After the controller finishes executing business logic, it sets the result in Model and returns the logical view name to DispatcherServlet. With the application of ViewResolver, the physical page is returned into the view. Ultimately, the view is returned as the response. User Interface Modelling UI Modelling presents the proposed system with the possible design or layout of the user interface. The user interface is modelling through the prototyping methodology. The prototypes are mentioned below as: Image- 52: Login Page Prototype Image- 53:Forgot Password Page Prototype Image- 54:Dashboard Page Prototype Image- 55: Add User Page Prototype Image- 56:Display User Page Prototype Image- 57:Edit User Page Prototype Image- 58: Manage User Profile Page Prototype Image- 59:Student Profile Page Prototype Image- 60:Faculty Member Profile Page Prototype Image- 61:Organization Information Page Prototype Image- 62:Add Notice Page Prototype Image- 63:Manage Notice Page Prototype Chapter 4: Implementation Programming Language Used JAVA 8 is the programming language used to develop the overall system. On top of this language, Spring framework is used for the foundation of this system. More specifically, this framework comprises of Spring MVC, Spring Security and Spring Test. In case of view or the user interface, Java Server Pages (JSP) renders the complete web page. Along with JSP, for server-side manipulation of the view, JSTL (JavaServer Pages Standard Tag Library) is used whereas, for client-side manipulation JavaScript is used. Moreover, for asynchronous web request and response, AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) is used along with JQuery. Integrated Development Environment (IDE) IntelliJ IDEA ULTIMATE 2019.1.1 is an IDE that is used for the development of this project. For the quick and convenient development work, this IDE was chosen as it is the smart IDE for Java developers.

Use of JSP in spite of emergence of front-end technologies such as Angular framework makes the program to consume more resources because the complete webpage must be reserved by the server when a request is made. ? The form templates are not dynamic and this may result in additional work when specific requirement of particular organization is required to meet. Future work of the project ? Intensive testing must be performed by testing it in real scenario of the educational organization. ? Additional appropriate charts and graphs must be integrated. ? Separate transaction module must be created and integrated, and should replace the current one which is very simple. ? Notification must be real-time and should be build using web-sockets instead of asynchronous request and response.

The major steps include: 1. Identification of risks 2. Risk and Vulnerability assessment 3. Identification of risk reduction measures 4. Prioritization of risk reduction measures The risk assessment is performed on the basis of following factors: ? Consequence ? Likelihood ? Risk The relation between these factors is given by, Risk (Impact) = Consequence x Likelihood Hence, with the reference of following table, the risk analysis is carried out as: Image- 159: Risk Analysis Lookup Table The possible risks that were proposed in the proposal are analyzed here in the table below: Risk Likelihood Consequence Impact Occurred Measures Taken Addition of extra features that were not included in project scope 1 5 5 No N/A Deadline Overruns 2 4 8 No N/A Hardware failure 2 4 8 No N/A Natural calamities 1 5 5 No N/A Vulnerabilities in project dependencies 2 4 8 Yes Performed impact analysis and switched to secure dependency.

All the project features have been developed as per the proposed objectives of the project. The system has been analyzed using OOA Modellings where its application provided the functional and non-functional requirements. Moreover, the system specification has been mentioned for the configuration of the software. Along with that, the system is modelled using different UML diagrams which helped for the implementation of the proposed design. In addition, effective data centric testing has been carried out in repository level to ensure that the functionality is working properly. Hence, with the appropriate implementation of all software development methodologies, this project has been developed completely meeting all the functional and non-functional requirements mentioned in the requirement specification. This project is applicable in an educational institution. Chapter 8: References and Bibliography 1.
